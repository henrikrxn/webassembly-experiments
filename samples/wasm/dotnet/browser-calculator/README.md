# .NET WebAssembly Browser app

Followed the instructions from Microsoft's documentation [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/dotnet-interop?view=aspnetcore-7.0).

The Build and Run sections below have not been modified from the templates.

Generated by `dotnet new wasmbrowser` abd then modified to have two methods:

`int Add(int x, int y)`

Returns x + y

`int Substract(int x, int y)`

Returns x - y

And the JavaScript main calls both.

## Build

You can build the app from Visual Studio or from the command-line:

```
dotnet build -c Debug/Release
```

After building the app, the result is in the `bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle` directory.

## Run

You can build the app from Visual Studio or the command-line:

```
dotnet run -c Debug/Release
```

Or you can start any static file server from the AppBundle directory:

```
dotnet tool install dotnet-serve
dotnet serve -d:bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle
```
