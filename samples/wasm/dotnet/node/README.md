# .NET WebAssembly Node app

Basically the same as the [dotnet/browser](../browser) sample just for node.

Generated by `dotnet new wasmconsole` and then modified a little to have different names in each of the dotnet projects, which is usefull when dealing with browser caching.

## Build

You can build the app from Visual Studio or from the command-line:

```
dotnet build -c Debug/Release
```

After building the app, the result is in the `bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle` directory.

## Run

You can build the app from Visual Studio or the command-line:

```
dotnet run -c Debug/Release
```

Or directly start node from the AppBundle directory:

```
node bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle/main.mjs
```
