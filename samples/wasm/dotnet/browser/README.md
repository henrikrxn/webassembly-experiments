# .NET WebAssembly Browser app

Followed the instructions from Microsoft's documentation [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/dotnet-interop?view=aspnetcore-7.0).

Generated by `dotnet new wasmbrowser` and then modified a little to have different names in each of the dotnet projects, which is usefull when dealing with browser caching.

The Build and Run sections below have not been modified from the templates.

## Build

You can build the app from Visual Studio or from the command-line:

```
dotnet build -c Debug/Release
```

After building the app, the result is in the `bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle` directory.

## Run

You can build the app from Visual Studio or the command-line:

```
dotnet run -c Debug/Release
```

Or you can start any static file server from the AppBundle directory:

```
dotnet tool install dotnet-serve
dotnet serve -d:bin/$(Configuration)/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle
```
