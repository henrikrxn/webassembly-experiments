# The WebAssmebly (WASM) samples

For WASM I'll try a two pronged approach:

- The browser "Hello world" i.e. a WASM mocule that can be called in a JavaScript setting in a browser. 
  There are plenty blog posts about this so it is a good way to get started for a language, especially the ones I do not know.
- A "calculator" module that exports two functions `add(x, y) = x + y` and `subtract(x, y) = x -y`.
  The module is purely computational in nature, i.e. has no dependency and requirements for the system executing it.
