# webassembly-experiments

This repository contains experiments with WebAssembly and using it across different languages.

So far it contains:

* `wasiconsole-hello-world`
  Building a WASI compliant WASM file on .NET 8, which is currently in Preview 5.
  Currently only writes to console and should be expanded to do the same as the `go` sample, i.e. use functionality only available in WASI.
* `samples\wasi\go`
  Hello World in go. Copied from [meteatamel/wasm-basics](https://github.com/meteatamel/wasm-basics/tree/main/samples/go-wasm)
* `dotnet-calling-wat`
  Using [bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet) to call some simple wat code
* `samples\wasm\dotnet` contains three samples of dotnet WASM being called by JavaScript. Two of them are basically the code generated by `dotnet new <template>` where template is `wasmbrowser` and `wasmconsole` for node.js. Used .NET 7 for everything as I am using WSL2 for `node` stuff because `nvm` is easier to work with on that platform. The third example is a "calculator" WASM module with two exported functions `Add` and `Subtract`.
